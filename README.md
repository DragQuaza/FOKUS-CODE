# FOKUS-CODE
🚀 Introducing FOKUS CODE — The Ultimate Productivity Tool for Coders
Watching Netflix? Scrolling Instagram? When you should be solving problems or watching tutorials on YouTube?
If you're prepping for contests, building consistency, or trying to level up your skills, you’re not alone — and we’ve built just the tool for you.

That’s why we built FOKUS CODE — a one-stop productivity solution that helps you block distractions and stay locked in.

🔐 Here’s what it does:
✅ Blocks all non-coding websites in Focus Mode (yes, even Netflix & Instagram)
✅ Allows only trusted coding platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder, and even YouTube for tutorials
✅ Shows upcoming contests across platforms
✅ Tracks your ratings on Codeforces, LeetCode, CodeChef, and AtCoder
✅ Lets you add custom coding domains you trust
